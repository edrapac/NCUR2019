# NCUR2019

### Where to start?

Sorry this is so messy everyone! Right now, you can find the most "recent" build of PassAudit in the Experiment folder. The Jupyter notebook "Character_level_Word_Embedding" has mny errors and several cells won't run due to them being used purely for debugging. We will be cleaning this up in the coming weeks for CIACAM.

### How can I help?
Create a pull request and we will get in touch with you soon.

### To all those who are here from my NCUR presentation, thank you!
